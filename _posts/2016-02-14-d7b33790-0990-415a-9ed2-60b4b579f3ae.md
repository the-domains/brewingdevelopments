# Business Website Hit with Copyright Lawsuit Settles for Use of Unlicensed Images
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b3e5ac09-c717-49a3-9d30-9ceccf9618de.jpg)

Breweries - new and established - like most businesses have websites and actively participate in social media. But if you went and looked at your brewery's website, Facebook, or other marketing materials could you

confidently say you properly own or license every image on that website? Answering this question could be mean the difference between focusing on the next production of brew or hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees. 

Consider the recent example of [an attorney who got hit with a copyright infringement lawsuit][0] for using stock photos without permission. The attorney owned his own law firm and had used stock images of men and women in suits on his business website. These images, however, were not licensed, which resulted in a copyright infringement lawsuit. That lawsuit requested the maximum damages of $150,000 for each instance of willful copyright infringement, along with other relief that may be appropriate under applicable federal law. 

According to the complaint, the business/attorney removed the photos shortly after the license holder/plaintiff (Masterfile) sent a cease and desist letter in February 2013 that the photos were not licensed or otherwise authorized to be used on the business website. Masterfile represented that the attorney didn't respond to the company's efforts to reach a settlement before the lawsuit was filed.

**Take-Away for Brewery Owners**

The owners of any new business understand the need to watch every penny, including when it comes to spending money for websites and other marketing efforts.  But, as the case above illustrates, cutting corners when it comes to properly licensing images and other stock photos for website and marketing collateral can end up costing the business big time down the road. In this regard, even though the defendant business owner discussed above and up settling for "only" $8â€‹000 to resolve the copyright infringement claim, it could have been much worse. 

For these reasons breweries and business owners need to be cautious about making sure they own or have the right to use photos and other media that is often found on their websites and in other marking materials. This is especially true if you delegate website development or internet marketing to employees or outside companies who may not understand the importance of properly handling intellectual property or otherwise ignore such issues.
