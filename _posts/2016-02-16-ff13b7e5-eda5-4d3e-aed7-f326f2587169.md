BarFly Ventures, LLC, owner and operator of HopCat, is venturing into marketing and distributing its Beer Right Meow American India Pale Aleh. BarFly has partnered with contract brewery Brew Detroit, LLC for this venture. 

[Nick Manes][0] of Crain's Detroit reports that according to BarFly's executive, Chris Knape, BarFly's vice president of marketing and communications: 
> 
> We're taking this one step at a time. We're optimistic, but we're trying to be very respectful of the beer. We want to stand out in what's a really crowded market. This is just our way of dipping our toe in the water.

BarFly is on a roll with respect to expansion and, more importantly, funding. Specifically, in September it secured $25 million in financing from two Texas companies. This financing is anticipated to expand the HopCat brand into new markets with a target of six new locations per year for the next six years.
